Differential abundance analysis for shotgun metagenomics


## Summary

This is a simple wrapper that invokes several methods for differential abundance analysis.

For a single fixed variable the following methods are run:

1. DeSeq
2. Maaslin2
3. EdgeR
4. MetagenomeSeq
5. ANCOM2
6. ANCOM-BC

For two fixed variables the following methods are run:
1. DeSeq
2. Maaslin2
3. ANCOM-BC

For fixed variables and a random variable (like subject in repeated measures) the following methods are run:

1. DeSeq
2. Maaslin2
3. ANCOM-BC

## Input

Following inputs files required:

1. A comma separated species table is required. See [example](example/merged_species_table.csv)

2. A metadata file for example see [file](example/TS_metadata.txt)

3. The name of the column in the metadata file that is the variable of interest. 

4. Set  min_abund: Minimum total abundance of a taxa required to be kept for further analysis

5. Set min_prevelance: Minimum number of samples that a taxa should be present in.

6. Output_dir: Output directory where all the results are saved.


An analysis.Rmd file has the complete workflow that can be used for Metaphlan3 results and for pathway abundace tables from Humann3.

## Good to know

Most of the methods used here have a lot of variables that
